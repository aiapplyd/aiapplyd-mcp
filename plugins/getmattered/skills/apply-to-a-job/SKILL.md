name: apply-to-a-job
description: Send a real job application with GetMattered. It tailors the resume and cover letter, then fills in and submits the employer's own hiring form (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workable and 29 more hiring systems). Use this skill whenever the user wants to apply to a job, send or submit an application, auto-apply, says "go ahead and apply" or "yes" to a match, or pastes a job link and says apply. Also use it when the user wants to turn Auto Apply on or off or switch between review and auto mode.

# Apply to a job

Start here. Call `getmattered_get_account` first. If its readiness shows no resume on file, call `getmattered_set_resume` before anything else, with exactly one of `resume_text` (the full text), `resume_url` (an https link to a PDF, DOCX or text file), `document_id` (a saved resume from the account, which is free) or, in ChatGPT, `resume_file` (a file the user attached). If the tool says no account is connected, share the sign-up link it gives and stop. If `getmattered_set_resume` says the resume is still being read, call `getmattered_get_account` again in a minute, and apply only once it shows the resume on file. A new import can use AI credits. Get approval for that import before calling it. Do not buy credits or upgrade the account.

1. Pick the job. `getmattered_apply` takes `job_match_id` (from the find-matching-jobs skill) or `job_url` for a posting the user pasted. Pass one of them, not both.
2. Pick the mode for `getmattered_apply`. `mode: "auto"` submits with no review step. `mode: "review"` prepares everything and holds it for the user's approval. Leave `mode` out to follow the user's account setting, which `getmattered_get_account` shows as the default apply mode. The mode covers this one application only.
3. Check the plan. Before you apply to several jobs, call `getmattered_get_account` to see how many applications are left. Sending an application to the employer needs a paid plan (https://getmattered.com/pricing). If readiness lists empty profile fields that employer forms need, ask the user for them and save only what they state with `getmattered_update_job_preferences` and `application_answers`. When `getmattered_update_application_profile` is in the tool list, use it for these answers instead, because it covers more form fields.
4. Confirm once with the user before a send. Name the job, the company and the mode. If you call `getmattered_apply` with no `mode`, say which default applies, because the default may submit with no review step. An application sent in auto mode goes out under the user's name and cannot be withdrawn. One clear yes can cover a list of jobs the user named, but never a job they have not seen.
5. Call `getmattered_apply` with the job, and the `mode` if one was picked. The server may also ask the user in its own confirmation form. That is expected. If the user says no there, nothing is sent.
6. Report only what the tool returned: the application id, the status and the tracking link. If the job already had an application, the tool returns that one instead of a second.
7. Never say the application landed until the employer confirms it. The employer's receipt, or its confirmation page, is the only proof, and `getmattered_get_applications` marks it as employer confirmed. A submit click is not proof.
8. If the application is held for review, use the review-and-send skill. If the plan does not cover it, pass on the tool's message as written and link https://getmattered.com/pricing. Never buy a plan or credits during this workflow.
9. On a timeout or an error, call `getmattered_get_applications` before you retry, because the application may already have started. Never call `getmattered_apply` again by `job_url` for a job already applied to by `job_match_id`.

Apply only when the user asks. `getmattered_auto_apply` is an older name for `getmattered_apply` with a `job_url`. Prefer `getmattered_apply`.

## Turn Auto Apply on or off

While Auto Apply is on, GetMattered starts applications every day with no request for each job. Change it with `getmattered_update_auto_apply` only when the user asks.

1. Call `getmattered_get_account` to read the current settings.
2. Pass only what the user asked to change: `enabled`, `default_apply_mode` ("review" holds each application for approval, "auto" sends it with no review), `daily_limit` (1 to 50, and the plan can cap it lower) or `match_level` ("excellent", "strong", "good" or "stretch").
3. Before you turn it on or choose "auto", tell the user that applications will go out under their name every day, and in auto mode with no review. Act only on a clear yes. The server may also ask in its own confirmation form.
4. Turning it on needs the Hired Yesterday plan. On another plan the tool says so and nothing changes. Pass its message on as written.
5. Report the settings the tool returned. Follow what Auto Apply starts with `getmattered_get_applications`. In review mode, use the review-and-send skill.

`default_apply_mode` is also the mode `getmattered_apply` uses when `mode` is left out.
